Controller - Controllers in NestJS are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and providing responses. 
They serve as the entry points to your applicationâ€™s logic.

Module - Modules are containers for different parts of an application, such as controllers, services, and other related components. 
They serve as a way to organize and encapsulate the functionality of an application.

Services are typically used by controllers to perform various operations, such as querying a database, processing data, or interacting with external APIs.
